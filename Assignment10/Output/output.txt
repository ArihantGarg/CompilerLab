This is the final resulting Three Address Code from the given input:
TAC Code:

      x = 10
      y = 20
      T0 = y * 2.5
      T1 = x + T0
      z = T1
      T2 = x > y
      T3 = y > 20
      T4 = T2 and T3
      T5 = T4
      If ! (T5) goto L0
      print "x is greater than y"
      goto L1
 L0 : 
      print "y is greater than or equal to x"
 L1 : 
 L2 : 
      T6 = x < 100
      If ! (T6) goto L3
      T7 = x + y
      x = T7
      print x
      goto L2
 L3 : 
      y = scan()
       T9 = z / y
      z = T9
      print z
      exit
