# Lab Assignment 6: Lexical Analysis and Parsing

## Overview

In this lab assignment, we explore the fundamental concepts of Lexical Analysis and Parsing by utilizing Lex/Flex and Yacc/Bison tools. These tools are crucial in compiler design for generating lexical analyzers and parsers, respectively. The assignment involves building a simple parser that recognizes arithmetic expressions containing addition and multiplication operations, as well as properly nested parentheses.

## Objectives

- Understand the working of the lexical analysis generator tool (Lex/Flex).
- Gain hands-on experience with the parser generator tool (Yacc/Bison).
- Learn how to integrate a lexical analyzer and parser to create a functional compiler component.
- Develop and test a simple parser for arithmetic expressions.

## Files Included

- **parser.l**: Lex specification file that defines the lexical analyzer.
- **parser.y**: Yacc specification file that defines the grammar and parsing rules.
- **Makefile**: A makefile to automate the compilation and execution of the parser.
- **input.txt**: Sample input file containing test expressions to be parsed.

## Lex Specification (parser.l)

The `parser.l` file defines the tokens recognized by the lexical analyzer, including identifiers, arithmetic operators, and parentheses. The corresponding actions return token values to the parser.

## Yacc Specification (parser.y)

The `parser.y` file defines the grammar of arithmetic expressions and the parsing rules. It uses the tokens generated by the lexical analyzer to parse the input and validate its structure.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the parser, follow these steps:

### Compile the Lex and Yacc specifications:
```bash
lex parser.l
yacc -d parser.y
gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o parser -ll
```

### Run the Parser with Input:
```bash
./parser < input.txt
```

The parser will read the expressions from input.txt and output whether they are accepted based on the defined grammar.

## Example Input and Output

### Input 
```
(id + id) * id
```

### Output
```
Accepted
```

The first expression is valid according to the grammar and will be accepted.

### Input 
```
id + id * (id +
```

### Output
```
Error: syntax error at line 1
```

 The second expression has unmatched parentheses and will result in a syntax error.

## Additional Notes

- The `Makefile` simplifies the compilation and execution process. Run `make run` to compile and execute the parser with the test input.
- The error handling in `parser.y` ensures that syntax errors are caught, and the line number is reported for easier debugging.
